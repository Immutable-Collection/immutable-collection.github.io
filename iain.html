  Wrote my first program more than 50 years ago, although I never got to see the computer it ran on.
  That was secreted in some hallowed hall in the University of Nottingham.
  I did get to punch my own cards, and I also got hauled up in front of the headmaster weeks after
  I got back to school for "wasting computer time".
  The output from my last job that hadn't completed by the time we had to return to school had been
  sent on. I was experimmenting with text formatting,
  daydreaming about word processing possibilities long before they were everywhere.
  This was not considered appropriate, or serious enough to justify the
  computer time involved. Ooops.
  The first computer I owned was a ZX81, and this involved switching from Fortran to Basic.
  I didn't like either of those much, and I ended up installing FORTH
  by way of a replacement rom. That was a fascinating experience, seeing just how much could be
  done with such limited processing power and memory.
  FORTH is one of those languages like lisp and apl, that shapes the way the programmer thinks.
  Although its no longer of much (if any) practical use it still had
  much to teach on the ways of development.
  Around that time I also did some hardware hacking and machine coding in Z80 and 6809 assembly language.
  Not long after I had my first brush with Lisp, taught as almost an afterthought at university
  that largely used Pascal. I loved the weirdness of it,
  but never did quite grasp why so many thought it was "difficult".
  I was dissappointed  to realise that the Uni were not going to teach me any C which was where it was
  at at the time, so I taught myself, and wrote my undergrad final project in it (a Petri Net Simulator)
  Between then and more modern times I have done quite a range of things, including:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>implementing a boundary scan (JTAG) system for testing complex circuit boards
    in fault tolerant telecoms systems. First in PERL, then again in C/C++ when the Perl proved to be too slow. </li>
  <li>Some ruby on rails </li>
  <li>Lots of sysadmin, mostly for a Uni Comp-Sci research department, So all sorts of wierd and wonderful stuff</li>
  <li>Javascript, Phonegap/Cordova, Angular and numerous other associated things</li>
</ul>

  Then I discovered Clojure. Initially I used it for myself, writting software to assist in the
  rapid processing of photographs. I was working as a self employed
  dive photographer at the time and needed to be able to tag, select and publish photos
  for customers an the same day and still be ready to dive early the next morning.
  I still use the system and it is visible on github, but I found I was enjoying the clojure
  even more than the photography, which kind of surprised me. 
  At this point I started looking for full time Clojure programming work.
