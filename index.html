    <h1>The Immutable Collection</h1>
    <p>
      We are small group of individuals with a vast range of software development experience covering technology 
      all the way from punching cards for FORTRAN programs to handling the aberations of cutting edge AI. 
      We are not only developers, we have a thorough understanding of the whole development process.

    <p>
      A love of Clojure is a common theme, and we have considerable experience there. 
      This goes well past the initial honeymoon period where devs that discover Clojure don't want to use anything else, 
      and into a much deeper understnding, such that we know why Clojure is so good. 
      We can apply that understnding to producing good code in any programming language needed. 
      This is where the name comes from. Immutability is one of the keys to Clojures superpower.
      It is part of the process that enables the writing of code that can be understood and expanded 
      long after most code has hit the complexity wall.
